## Any comments, notes or considerations
**NOTE 1:**
When creating vertices my application(s) will NOT allow one to create a new vertex that intersects with an existing vertex.  
Please note this is by design (I could easily remove it). Thus, some clicks *seem* like they may be doing nothing but in reality there is just not enough space
between an existing vertex and a new one.  The console displays a message indicating this behavior. I did not keep this when dragging as it did not feel quite right.

**NOTE 2:** 
In the images and description for part 1: Shift+Click shows a vertex that is NOT orange, but blue with a border. This is what I
implemented. In part two the description asks for behavior that is the same as part one, but with the extra additions. However, during
Dr. Bateman's brief demo today there also seemed to be an orange vertex when Shift+Clicking. It would be trivial to change this, however I've decided to leave it as, what
I interpret to be, the spec of the assignment.
